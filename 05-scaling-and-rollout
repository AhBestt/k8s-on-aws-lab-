# Lab 5: Scaling Deployments & Recording Rollouts

## Objective

This lab demonstrates how to:
- Scale a Kubernetes Deployment up or down
- Record changes using the `--record` flag
- View rollout history of a deployment

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you already have an existing deployment, e.g. `nginx-deployment`.  
You can create it from this file:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml


## Step-by-step Commands

1. View Deployment
kubectl get deployment
kubectl get pod

2. Scale the Deployment (Increase)
kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=4
kubectl get pod

3. Scale the Deployment (Decrease)
kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=3
kubectl get pod

4. Record Scaling History
kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=5 --record
kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=3 --record

5. View Rollout History
kubectl rollout history deployment nginx-deployment
