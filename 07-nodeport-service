# Lab 7: Exposing Services with NodePort

## Objective

In this lab, you will expose a Deployment using a `NodePort` type Service, which allows external access to your app via `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.

---

## Concepts

| Service Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `ClusterIP` (default) | Internal-only, accessible only from inside the cluster |
| `NodePort`           | Exposes service on a static port on **all worker nodes** for external access |

---

## Setup Steps

1.Clean up any previous services

```bash
kubectl delete svc nginx-service
kubectl get svc

2. Edit or Create nginx-service-2.yaml

Noted: nodePort must be in the range 30000â€“32767, You can omit it and let Kubernetes auto-assign one

3. Apply the Service
kubectl apply -f nginx-service-2.yaml
kubectl get svc

4. Access the App from Browser
Get Public IP of any Worker Node (EC2 Public IP) 
Visit in browser:
http://<NodeIP>:<NodePort>
