# Lab 3: Expose NGINX Deployment with Service

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

In this lab, we expose the existing NGINX Deployment (from Lab 2) using a Kubernetes `Service`.  
This allows users to access the application through a NodePort from outside the cluster.

---

## ðŸ§± Components

- `deployment.yaml` â€” Same as Lab 2 (NGINX Deployment)
- `service.yaml` â€” A `NodePort` Service to expose the Deployment

---

## ðŸ“¦ Apply to Cluster

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
